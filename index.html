                    <p>Hi, I'm Leti and I'm an aspiring web designer based in Manchester, England. I have been learning to code properly for about 6 months and I still feel like I know nothing.
                        Apparently that never goes away. Stay tuned.<br>
                        At the moment I work on a psychiatric ward in the Occupational Therapy department, as a 'technical instructor'. What this means is that I do activities and assess whether
                        my patients are safe when crossing the road and cooking. <br>
                        In my spare time I do a lot of yoga, cooking, reading, and whatever craft activity I have gotten myself into during said time period. At the moment I've dipped my 
                        toes back into painting animals in human scenarios though last week it was embroidery. Variety is the spice of life.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I've been specializing in making proper hideous websites, in order to make the learning process more comical so I'm less inclined 
                        to slam my head against the desk when my code doesn't work as I want it to. Click on the subheadings below to see some of my
                        abominations.
